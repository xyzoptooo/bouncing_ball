## Objectives


Create smooth CSS transitions and animations.  
Use JavaScript functions for dynamic behavior.  
Implement local storage for data persistence.

## Instructions

Add CSS animations to elements like buttons or images.

>[!NOTE]
> - Write a JavaScript function that:
> - Stores and retrieves user preferences using localStorage.
> - Implements an animation triggered by user actions.

## Tasks

Create a CSS animation.  
Store data in localStorage.  
Apply JavaScript to trigger animations.

##Solved by the Bouncing Ball Game Project

This project implements a "Bouncing Ball Game" that fulfills the assignment objectives as follows:

- **CSS Animations:**  
  The project uses CSS keyframe animations such as `pulse` and `glow` to provide visual feedback when the user changes ball color or speed preferences. These animations are applied dynamically to input controls and the game container.

- **JavaScript Functions:**  
  The game logic is implemented in JavaScript, which handles drawing and animating the ball on an HTML5 canvas. The ball bounces within the canvas boundaries, and its properties (color, speed) are updated based on user input.

- **Local Storage:**  
  User preferences for ball color and speed are stored in the browser's `localStorage`. When the page loads, these preferences are retrieved and applied, ensuring persistence across sessions.

- **User Interaction:**  
  The project includes input controls for selecting the ball color and speed. Changing these inputs triggers CSS animations and updates the game behavior in real-time.

This combination of CSS animations, JavaScript functions, and localStorage usage demonstrates the key concepts outlined.
